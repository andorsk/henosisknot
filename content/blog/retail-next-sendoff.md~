Leaving RetailNext was the first "real" job I have ever left, and I could not have asked for a better sendoff. I have so many close colleagues and friends I've made over my three years at the company and I could not be more grateful or humbled to have had them as friends. I am going to miss most of them deeply, as they truly are amazing people. A few takeaways from my experience leaving my first company.

1. Leave on a good note
   - Life's too short. No reason to burn bridges if you don't have to.
2. Give early advance and be willing to sludge through a few extra weeks.
   - When I decided to leave RetailNext, I was ready to pick up my stuff and go from the moment I made the decision.
   - It really took me 5 weeks to get everything pushed off.
   - Don't be impulsive if you ever decide to quit your job and leave on a dime. Do the responsible thing and make sure all your projects are closed and that the company can survive without you being there. There's also another advantage of this: The colleages that you do connect with....spend time with them and strengthen your connections before leaving. Finding colleagues that you enjoyed working with could be invaluable.
3. Don't be the center of attention
   - Because I gave the company a heads up earlier than most it was pretty easy to feel like the "lame duck" distraction that nobody wants to hang out with. If you can, work as much as you can remotely as your phase out to be less of a distraction.

REMEMBER: You'll have your moment of freedom in time. Your job in this case is to make sure nobody feels like you left them behind!
