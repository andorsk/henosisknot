Leaving RetailNext was the first "real" job I have ever left, and I could not have asked for a better sendoff. I have so many close colleagues and friends I've made over my three years and I could not be more grateful or humbled to have had them as friends. I am going to miss most of them deeply, as they truly are amazing people. A few takeaways from my experience leaving my first company.

1. **Leave Strong**
   - Life's too short. No reason to burn bridges if you don't have to.
2. **Give advance notice and be willing to sludge through a few extra weeks.**
   - I know professional courtesy normally recommends to 2 weeks in advance notice. I gave 5. 
   - When I decided to leave RetailNext, I was ready to pick up my stuff and go from the moment I made the decision.
   - Don't be impulsive if you ever decide to quit your job and leave on a dime. I'm glad I didn't.
       - This is a decision that will impact you for a while. 
       - Do the responsible thing and make sure all your projects are closed and that the company can survive without you being there.
    - Strengthen your existing connections during this time.
       - For those colleagues that you did enjoy working with, strengthen you connections as much as you can. **Your friends should not be a matter of convinence**. Keep the ones close to you after you leave. 
3. **Try not to be the center of attention**
   - Full disclosure: I struggled with this one.
   - Because I gave the company a heads up earlier than most it was pretty easy to feel like the "lame duck" distraction that nobody wants to hang out with.
        - If you can, work as much as you can remotely as you phase out to be less of a distraction.

REMEMBER: You'll have your moment of freedom in time. Your job for a little longer is to make sure nobody feels like you left them behind!

### Some of the fun stuff I did my last 5 weeks.

1. I went camping near Chico State with a few colleagues. We had a blast in the wilderness.
2. Enjoy a true Indian brunch with an amazing colleague and her husband (Thanks Jinal!)
3. Got to have unrestritcted conversations with colleagues and friends (people tell you things when you are leaving).
4. Asked for professional feedback.
5. Spent time with friends that I made in San Jose. Even going **Salsa** dancing.
6. Learned how to cook a chicken for a dinner party (Awesome dinner Bridget!)
7. Drinks, Drinks, Drinks
8. Food, Food, and more Food (Including hand made pizza!!!! (Bill, you're an amazing pizza maker)
9. Awesome happy hour for my final sendoff.
10. Enjoyed a few loose weekends at the beach.
11. Spent a day with a crush. 
    
Overall, I made what could have been a very painful experience into something that I will also be able to look back on fondly.

Words from the heart,
