# What is HenosisKnot?

Zuckerberg once said "If you just work on stuff that you like and you’re passionate about, you don’t have to have a master plan with how things will play out." I started Henosisknot.com because about 5 years ago I was obsessed with the idea of solving world problems through technology. 

Henosisknot is a reference to the Gordian Knot, a Macedonian tale in which Alexander the Great attempted to untie an "impossible knot" in Gordium. Alexander the Great conquered the challenge, but only by thinking "outside" the box and severing the knot with a sword, rather than trying to untie it. Due to the necessity of unique thinking, the Gordian Knot became a methaphor for an "impossible problem".

"Henosis", is the Greek word for unity. Rather than solve a convoluted knot in Gordium, I want to sever the challenging knot of unity by bringing the world together through my blog, travels, and technology. 

Welcome to Henosisknot.com, where I will log my epic quest around the world, pursuing my intellectual interests, and hopefully sharpen the sword that will cut the knot of disunity and bring the world together.
